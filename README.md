#Elements in the challenge to exemplify my proficiency

 

--> I have made the changes to state immutable in a component. 
--> I have separated the functional components and class components. 
    Functional components are placed in components folder and class components are placed in containers.
--> I have used lifecycle methods to call APIs.
--> The data is showcased in a structured format.
--> Dynamically filtering and displaying the search results by searching the API.
--> I have displayed the upcoming movies in movie cards by sorting the latest first.
--> I have allowed infinite scrolling in the list page.
--> Onclick on movie card, app navigates to details page successfully.

 

The above points demonstrate my experience in React.js
I have used the knowledge gained in my current work to achieve the above successfully.

 

#Improve the solution

 

--> I would have made the application more responsive.
--> I would have rendered the CSS conditionally.

 
I would have done the above to improve the user experience and better the look and feel of the application.
